A simple web-scraping script to find all relevant extracts from Earnings Call Transcripts of S&amp;P 500 companies in a given sector containing specified keywords.

This was done for an interview with an equity research firm.

It uses git code from the following sources:

• https://github.com/datasets/s-and-p-500-companies

• https://github.com/trinitybest/Web_Scraping_SeekingAlpha

Please note that in order to function properly you need to populate the keys.yaml file with your Seeking Alpha (free) account login details as follow:

username: <your email address, used to log into Seeking Alpha>
password: <your Seeking Alpha password>
